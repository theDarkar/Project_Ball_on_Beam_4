Construction

Tuesday 29th Jan. 2019 (?)
- Bought the rail that ball is going to roll down at Biltema, and brought a plank to build the project on. Servo and sensor ordered by Anders Sætermoen
- Cut off a part of the rail to use as the pillar that the rail pivots on
- Cut off pieces of the plank so the pillar and servo could have something to stand on to keep the rail higher above the ground, allowing for more freedom of movement
- Drilled a hole in the end of the two pieces of rail so they could be attached by a screw and rotate
- Pillar piece had its edges widened so the rail could fit. 
- Attached the two pieces of rail to eachother

Friday February 1st Feb. 2019
- Received servo and sensors from Anders Sætermoen
- Cut out a small piece of wood for the servo to sit on, and made a 3D-printed frame for the servo to sit in
- Started looking for ways to raise and lower the rail, found a rotateable(?) arm that we decided to use. 
- Started working on a way to attach the arm to the servo. Decided to use a circular plate as a base and then attach a steel/aluminum/whatever beam between it and the arm. 
- Created a mount for the sensors to attach to the end of the rail, and a small barrier at the other end of the rail to prevent the ball from falling off the backside

Tuesday 5th Feb. 2019
- Attached pillar to the plank
- Got breadboard, power cable, wires and potentiometer to attach to the plank
- Tested what position and angle would be best for the servo to raise and lower the rail
- Tried to attach the wooden block from earlier to put servo on, it cracked when getting drilled into the plank, got new block of wood and put servo on that instead. 
- 3D-printed frame proved too weak, and was replaced with a more solid mount
- Drilled out a hole in the bottom of the rail to attach it to the arm. 
- Rail was wobbling a bit from side to side when moving up and down, so decided to put two pillars on each side of the end of the rail to keep it stable when going up and down
- Cut out pillars, found a way to attach it to the plank
- Attached pillars to plank, and removed the small barrier from earlier due to being unnecessary
- Pillars were leaning away from eachother, causing the rail to wobble when high up. Pushed them closer together by connecting the top of the pillars with a piece of metal. 
- Finished attaching arduino components to plank
